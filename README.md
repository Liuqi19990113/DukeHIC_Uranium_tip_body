# DukeHIC_Uranium_tip_body
Some changes of Duke QCD HIC program to calculate tip or body config 

Based on Duke QCD's program: https://github.com/Duke-QCD/hic-eventgen

Some change in Trento and run-events to make sure and output the rotate angle, you can find it by search phrase "LiuQi"

Something wrong when I want to sample tilt angle: I randomly chose tile_angle rather than cos(tilt_angle), which is a wrong way and makes more tip collision.
I 'll change it and update in time

Something wrong with random sample in theta angle and I am too lazt to change it
